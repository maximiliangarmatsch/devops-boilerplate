### Why Superlinting ➝ Clean Code ➝ Best Practice ➝ but why?

- Defines rules for how the code should look
- So multiple Developers can read each others code quickly
- Reduces bugs
- Prevents unclean code being saved to the main branch

### Commitlint

- Commitlint: <https://commitlint.js.org/>

### setup

- install commitlint-cli using : <br/>
  `npm install @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional --save-dev`
- create a new file 'commitlint.config.js' in root of project and add following
  configuration:

  ```
  module.exports = {
        extends: [
            "@commitlint/config-conventional"
        ],
    }
  }
  ```

- install husky and enable husky hooks <br/> `npm install husky --save-dev`
  <br/> `npx husky install`
- Add following script to enable commitlint with husky <br/>
  `npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1"`

### Usage

- Format of commit message is <br /> `git commit -m 'subject(scope?): message'`
- subject should be one of follwing types: <br />
  `[build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test]`
- scope is optional

### Example

- `git commit -m 'test:this is a test'`
- `git commit -m 'docs(commitlint): documentation'`

### Usage

### Environment variables

| ENV VAR                      | Description                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| LINTER_RULES_PATH            | Directory for all linter configuration rules. |
| JAVASCRIPT_ES_CONFIG_FILE    | Filename for ESLint configuration             |
| VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE        | Will parse the entire repository              |
|                              | and find all files to validate across         |
|                              | all types.                                    |
| VALIDATE_JAVASCRIPT_STANDARD | Flag to enable or disable the linting process |
|                              | of the JavaScript language                    |
| DEFAULT_BRANCH               | The name of the repository default branch.    |
|                              |                                               |

### Run the container Locally

- `docker run -e RUN_LOCAL=true -e USE_FIND_ALGORITHM=true -v /path/to/local/codebase:/tmp/lint github/super-linter`
  - To run against a single file you can use:
    `docker run -e RUN_LOCAL=true -e USE_FIND_ALGORITHM=true -v /path/to/local/codebase/file:/tmp/lint/file github/super-linter`
- **NOTE:** You need to pass the `RUN_LOCAL` flag to bypass some of the GitHub
  Actions checks, as well as the mapping of your local codebase to `/tmp/lint`
  so that the linter can pick up the code
- **NOTE:** If you want to override the `/tmp/lint` folder, you can set the
  `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` environment variable to point to the folder you'd prefer
  to scan.
- **NOTE:** The flag:`RUN_LOCAL` will set: `VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE` to true. This
  means it will scan **all** the files in the directory you have mapped. If you
  want to only validate a subset of your codebase, map a folder with only the
  files you wish to have linted
- **NOTE:** Add the `--rm` docker flag to automatically remove the container
  after execution.

### Troubleshooting

If you need to run the container locally use this command:

- `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash github/super-linter`
